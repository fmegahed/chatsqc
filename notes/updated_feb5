Work Done (2024-01-31 -- 2024-02-04):
-------------------------------------

[1] Wrote a script 'get_qrei.py', which filtered the papers that have CC BY and CC BY-NC
from the CSV provided by Wiley. Then I generated the URLs for the papers and saved them in a CSV file
titled "pdf_urls.csv".

[2] Manually downloaded the 37 PDFs from the URLs in the CSV file (Wiely blocked the automated download)

[3] Edited the read_and_preprocess_papers.py to make the following changes:
  - Added a new function to extract the License from CrossRef.
  - Edited the format apa_citation to include the license.
  - Automatically created a CSV of all our citations with the license to host on GitHub 
  [easier to manipulate than pickle file; we still use the pickle file for the app]  

[4] Updated the 3 files for the app: 
  - chatsqc.py: added a link to our entire collection of papers (the beauty of the CSV above) in the landing page.  
  - 02_ChatSQC-Research.py: 
    - updated the header. 
    - updated the note to highlight the papers that we are now using.  
    - edited the HTML linking function so it now works (given that the APA citation now includes the License so we cannot extract the URL just by specifying the end as I used to)
    - added a link to the CSV in the "About" page.  
    

Bug Discovered:
--------------
[1] The show text formatting is weird; I traced it down to the Langchain load_and_chunk function
in the read_and_preprocess_papers.py. Not sure what is the fix yet.
